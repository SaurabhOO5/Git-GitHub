what is git?
Ans--> git is a version control system that tracks changes in any computer files,usally used for maintaining a collaborative environment
for the programmers or others to work on a single project at the same time.

what is Github?
Ans--> Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git.

Git configure-
->git config --<global/local> user.name "<name>"                (local-> changes for particular repo and global-> changes in throughout the system)
->git config --<global/local> user.email "<email>"

git config --list -> information about your credentials.

git --version -> with this you can check if git is present or not or its version.

git clone <repo link> -> it copy whole repository to our local system.

git init-> powers your folder to be managed by git, it initialises a new empty repository.It also creates a .git folder 
which contain all logics to manage all versions of your project.

git status-> this command shows you in which area your files kept.

git add filename-> this command move a file from untracked area to staging area(A area in which git knows what changes
has to be made in the previous file).

git add -A-> this command is used to transfer all files to staging area.

git rm --cached filename-> this command is used to unstage the whole file(means move from stage to untracked area).

*repository area-> this area contain all your previous registered versions.All the files in this area,git manages
them and know their version history.

*commit-> commit is a particular version of the project. It captures the snapshot of project's staged changes and 
make a version out of it.

*git commit-> transfer staging changes to repository area.

*wq-> type this for exiting text editor like or vm window which appear after commit command.

git log-> list down all the commits of the repository.

git restore filename-> this command used to remove all files changes from the staging area to be committed.

git restore --staged filename-> it revert back to the working area and then apply restore command(restore command
only work on working area).

*git commit -m "<your commit message>" ->if you do not want to open text editor like window afer commiting then use this command for direct commit.

git remote -> list down all remote connection names.

remote connection -> it helps you to link two repositories of git for uploading and downloading changes from each other.

*git remote add <name of remote repo>< link of remote repo> -> this command helps us to build a link between local  or remote repository
to remote repository.

git remote rm <name of remote repo> -> it remove the connection between two repositories.

git remote rename <oldname><newname> -> helps us to change the name of repo.

*Note-> the name of the remote connection is always used to establish connection between two repositories.

*git push <name of remote repo><name of branch> -> this command helps us to push our repo to remote repository.

*git pull <remote name><branch name> -> downloads all the changes that are done in remote repo in the local repo.


------Recommended practice to do------
        make changes
        git add <filename>
        git commit
        git pull
        git push
